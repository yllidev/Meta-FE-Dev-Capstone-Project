# Meta front end developer professional certificate - Capstone Project

This project was created with the React Library
It includes react router dom and bootstrap for react
It contains only two working pages: The reservations page and the contact page link.

You will have to install both react router dom and bootstrap for react via npm to review the project

This website is only front end based (there is no server and/or database connected to it to send and store the form data on the back end)

npm install react-router-dom
npm install bootstrap

Thanks for reading :)
